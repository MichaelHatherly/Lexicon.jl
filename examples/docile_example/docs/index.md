# Docile

*Docile* is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package documentation system.

It provides a macro, `@doc`, for documenting arbitrary Julia objects. This
functionality is equivalent to the new `@doc` macro available from `Base` in
Julia `0.4`.

Additionally, *Docile* has support for using plain strings for documentation
rather than using the `@doc` macro. See the package documentation for further
details.
